<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
[//]: # (TODO)
Suppose you have a self-managed portfolio, and each month you add a portion of your income to your portfolio.
Suppose as well that you have a target asset allocation. For example:  
| Asset | Target Allocation |
|-------|-------------------|
| VTI   | 64%               |
| VXUS  | 16%               |
| BND   | 20%               |  

Using this app you will know how much of each asset to invest in order to be as close as possible 
to your target allocation - without selling any of your current assets.

### Built With

[//]: # (TODO)
* [Python 3.9](https://python.org/)
* [Kol Zchut](https://www.kolzchut.org.il/he/%D7%A2%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%93_%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%A9%D7%99)

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>


## Usage

[//]: # (TODO)
1. Fill `input.json` with:
   1. `target_allocation` - the percent you would like each asset to be in your portfolio.
   2. `deposit_amount` - how many dollars you are adding to your portfolio.
   3. `current_holdings` - How much do you have of each asset currently in your portfolio. 
2. Create a virtual environment (optional):  
    a. `python -m venv venv`  
    b. `venv\Scripts\activate` or in linux `source venv/bin/activate`
3. Install the requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Set the environment variable API_KEY to your Free financial modeling prep API key.
5. Run `python main.py`
6. Then the result will appear in a newly created file `result.json`. 

### What does it do?

[//]: # (TODO)
This app calculates the difference between your portfolio and the portfolio which has the same
market value but with the target allocation, then recommends you to buy the assets in such a way
that brings your portfolio as close as possible to the target portfolio allocation.  
You're welcome to take a look at the [`input.json`](input.json) currently in the repository.  
Here's an example for the content of the `result.json`:
```json
{
  "current_allocation": {
    "schd": 80.72,
    "vtv": 45.8,
    "upro": 28.14,
    "_cash": -54.66
  },
  "new_allocation": {
    "schd": 74.63,
    "vtv": 48.93,
    "upro": 25.55,
    "_cash": -48.76
  },
  "amount_to_purchase": {
    "_cash": 95,
    "vtv": 6,
    "schd": 2,
    "upro": 0
  }
}
```
In the above example we can see that the app recommends to purchase 6 stocks of VTV, 2 of SCHD and  
the $95 that are left from the deposited amount to leave as cash.  
We can also see that the new allocation is much closer to the targeted allocation than we were beforehand.
